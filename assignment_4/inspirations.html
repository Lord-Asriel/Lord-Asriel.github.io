                    <p>Valve is a software company based in Bellevue Washingon. This company is responsible for many
                        impressive
                        feats of computer software including Steam, the largest PC gaming platform.</p>
                    <p>Besides revolutionising the entire video game industry with this platform, Valve is responsible
                        for
                        some of
                        the
                        most renown video games of all time including Portal 2, Half-Life 2:
                        Episode
                        1,
                        Half-Life 2: Episode 2, Half-Life 2 and Portal.</p>
                    <p>These games are notable for their engines, which when released where better than anything
                        available in the market.</p>
                    <p>This company inspires me as they have demonstrated to me how powerful computer science can be as
                        a
                        means
                        of entertainment and storytelling</p>

                    <p>Undertale is a video game released in 2015 and created by Toby Fox.</p>
                    <p>Undertale has achieved success for its immersive storytelling, creative combat and morality
                        system
                        which
                        has
                        resulted in a very dedicated, almost obsessive fanbase.</p>
                    <p>This game inspired me to get into computer science. It showed me the true storytelling potential
                        of
                        the
                        medium, and demonstrated that if I put the effort in I could make my own game, as Toby Fox
                        himself
                        used
                        a
                        rudementary engine called GameMaker.</p>
                    <p>It demonstartes that even with the most limited of tools, it is possible to do something
                        technologically amazing.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>A video game speedrun is when a player attempts to get to the end, or an agreed point in a video
                        game,
                        as
                        fast
                        as possible. There are large and organised speedrunning communities online.</p>
                    <p>Speedruns range from playing the game normally, to exploited errors within the game's code, or
                        glitches.
                    </p>
                    <p>A Tool Assisted Speedrun is when there is no longer a human player attempting the speedrun, but
                        instead a
                        tool which has a desired input mapped to each of the game's frames. This allows for extreme
                        accuracy
                        and
                        much faster speeds than a human could achieve.</p>
                    <p>A TAS is extremely impressive to watch, as exploits that take a lot of skill to
                        master
                        are
                        performed flawlessly by a machine. It truly shows the power of somebody willing to look deep
                        into
                        the
                        code.

                    <p>Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is a popular manga and anime series created by Hirohiko Araki and
                        animated
                        by David Productions.</p>
                    <p>This story tells the generational tale of the Joestar bloodline and their fight against evil.</p>
                    <p>The manga currently has eight parts, with each being following a different generation. The first
                        five
                        parts have been animated.</p>
                    <p>Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is an amazing piece of animation and one of the culminations of
                        computer
                        science as an art form. It represents the frontier of visual technology, and its continuation
                        has been stunted by the currently available animation software, as its seventh part is currently
                        too expensive tp create.</p>
